🎉 Fun Calculator – Python Style! 😎
Welcome to the Fun Calculator, your entry-level Python project that adds ✨sparkle✨ to math operations! Whether you're a coding newbie or just brushing up, this little script helps you perform basic arithmetic like a boss.

🚀 What Does It Do?
This calculator:

✅ Takes two numbers as input from the user

✅ Calculates and displays:

➕ Sum

➖ Difference

✖️ Product

➗ Quotient

✅ Prints the results with flair 🎊

🛠️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python fun_calculator.py
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and get instant results!

💡 Features
Uses float() so you can do math with decimal numbers too!

Outputs are clear, colorful (if your terminal supports emoji 😉), and beginner-friendly.

Encourages good vibes with fun comments and structure.

⚠️ Note
This version assumes the user does not enter zero as the second number to avoid a division-by-zero error. A future version can include error handling — stay tuned! 🔧
